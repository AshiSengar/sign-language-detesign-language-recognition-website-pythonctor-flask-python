# Sign Language Recognition Website using Python

This project is a Sign Language Recognition system developed using Python, Flask, OpenCV, and Deep Learning.
It recognizes hand gestures in real time using a webcam and displays the detected sign on a web-based interface.

## Features
- Real-time sign language recognition
- Webcam-based gesture detection
- Flask-powered website interface
- Image preprocessing for better recognition

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- MediaPipe

## Future Enhancements
- Support for dynamic gestures and sentences
- Speech synthesis to convert signs into audio

## Acknowledgement
This project is inspired by open-source implementations and customized for academic and learning purposes.
